## NWTKlearn-experiment readme
##### Last updated AXL 20/09/2023

This repo contains the files needed to run both studies 1 and 2 associated with the working paper titled "The effect of non-instrumental information on reward learning". 

To run both experiments, open the `study_1.html`/`study_2.html` files with a web browser (right click > open with > e.g., Google Chrome). The other four folders (`cues`, `jspsych-6.0.5`, `NWTKimg`, and `sounds`) must be placed in the same directory as the html files.
